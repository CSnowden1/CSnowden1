###Christopher Snowden

#Front-end Developer | Philadelphia Sports Fan | Anime Enthusiast | Outdoor Adventurer


Hey there! I'm Christopher Snowden, a front-end developer with a passion for coding, sports, anime, and the great outdoors. I'm a huge fan of Philadelphia teams, including the Eagles and 76ers, and you can often find me watching NBA and NFL games in my free time. I'm also an avid anime watcher, and Sunday mornings are usually reserved for binge-watching my favorite shows, with Vinland Saga currently at the top of my list.

When I'm not watching sports or coding, I love spending time outside. I have an all-terrain electric skateboard that I take out to hit the trails in the DMV area, always on the lookout for new areas to explore. I find that being in nature helps me recharge and stay creative in my work.

I've been in frontend development for just over two years now, and I've learned a lot from resources like FreeCodeCamp and freelance projects on platforms like Fiverr and Upwork. One of my favorite things to do is build ecommerce stores, from designing the user interface to running ads and hiring people for branding. It can be a bit expensive, but once everything is up and running, it's a great way to make some side money. Currently, I'm working on building an online mall of dropshipping stores, and it's been a really fun experience so far.

In addition to ecommerce, I also enjoy researching and developing Micro SaaS (Software as a Service) products. It's exciting to see a donation or a subscription coming in from a Chrome extension or service that I've built. Frontend development is incredibly empowering to me because I get to come up with an idea, make it functional, and then continuously improve it over time.

One thing that often gets overlooked about frontend development is the amount of research and documentation reading that goes into it. It's a big part of the job, and I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest technologies, frameworks, and best practices to continuously improve my skills.

Currently, I would describe myself as a junior developer with less than five years of experience. I recently joined Bloom Tech's Full Stack Bootcamp in Frederick, MD to further hone my skills and land a job in the industry. The bootcamp has not only filled in some gaps in my knowledge but has also taught me the importance of teamwork and asking for help, which has made me a more collaborative and team-oriented developer.
