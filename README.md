<h2> Front-end Developer | Philadelphia Sports Fan | Anime Enthusiast | Outdoor Adventurer  </h2>


<h2>Hey there! My name is Christopher Snowden ðŸ‘‹<h2> 
  
<h3> I'm a front-end developer with a passion for coding &#x1F4BB;, sports &#x1F3C0;, anime &#x1F97D;, and the great outdoors &#x1F30D; </h3>

  
<p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive; font-size: 18px;">
  <span style="color: #e91e63;">I'm a huge fan of Philadelphia teams</span>,
  including the <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #212121;">Eagles</span> &#x1F3C6;
  and <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #ff5722;">76ers</span> &#x1F3C0;.
  I'm also an avid anime watcher &#x1F409;, and Sunday mornings are usually reserved for binge-watching my favorite shows,
  with <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #8bc34a;">Vinland Saga</span> &#x1F40D;
  currently at the top of my list.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8bbd0; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
  <h3 style="color: #e91e63;">When I'm not watching sports or coding...</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 18px;">
    I love spending time outside. &#x1F30E; I have an all-terrain electric skateboard that I take out to hit the trails in
    the DMV area, always on the lookout for new areas to explore. &#x1F6F6; I find that being in nature helps me
    recharge and stay creative in my work.
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="color: #ab47bc;">Frontend Development & Ecommerce</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 18px;">
    I've been in frontend development for just over two years now, and I've learned a lot from resources like
    FreeCodeCamp and freelance projects on platforms like Fiverr and Upwork. One of my favorite things to do is build
    ecommerce stores &#x1F4B3;, from designing the user interface to running ads and hiring people for branding. It can
    be a bit expensive, but once everything is up and running, it's a great way to make some side money. Currently,
    I'm working on building an online mall of dropshipping stores, and it's been a really fun experience so far.
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="color: #7cb342;">Micro SaaS & Continuous Improvement</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 18px;">
    In addition to ecommerce, I also enjoy researching and developing Micro SaaS (Software as a Service) products.
    It's exciting to see a donation or a subscription coming in from a Chrome extension or service that I've built. 
    Frontend development is incredibly empowering to me because I get to come up with an idea, make it functional,
    and then continuously improve it over time &#x1F4D7;.
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="color: #ffa726;">Stay Up-to-Date & Full Stack Bootcamp</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 18px;">
    One thing that often gets overlooked about frontend development is the amount of research and documentation reading
    that goes into it. It's a big part of the job, and I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest technologies,
    frameworks, and best practices to continuously improve my skills. Currently, I would describe myself as a junior
    developer with less than five years of experience. I recently joined Bloom Tech's Full Stack Bootcamp in Frederick,
    MD to further hone my skills and land a job in the industry. The bootcamp has not only filled in some gaps in my
    knowledge but has also taught me the importance of teamwork and asking for help, which has made me a more
    collaborative and team-oriented developer &#x1F64C;.
