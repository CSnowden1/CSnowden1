What's up?
My name is Chris, and I am a freelance Shopify developer. I work with brands and agencies, helping them build and modify their Shopify storefronts. I also post educational videos on YouTube, where I teach people how to build and modify their Shopify stores.

Inside this GitHub account, I have custom modifications and updates you can add to your Shopify for free.
