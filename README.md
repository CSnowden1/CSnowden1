<h3> I'm a full-stack developer. I enjoy &#x1F4BB;, sports &#x1F3C0;, anime &#x1F97D;, and  boarding &#x1F30D; </h3>

  
<p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive; font-size: 18px;">
  <span style="color: #e91e63;">I'm a huge fan of Philadelphia teams</span>,
  including the <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #212121;">Eagles</span> &#x1F3C6;
  and <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #ff5722;">76ers</span> &#x1F3C0;.
  I'm also an avid anime watcher &#x1F409;, and Sunday mornings are usually reserved for binge-watching my favorite show.

  <h3 style="color: #e91e63;">When I'm not watching sports or coding...</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 18px;">
    I love spending time outside. &#x1F30E; I have an all-terrain electric skateboard that I take out to hit the trails in
    the DMV area, always on the lookout for new areas to explore. &#x1F6F6; I find that being in nature helps me
    recharge and stay creative in my work.

  <h3 style="color: #ab47bc;">Frontend Development & Ecommerce</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 18px;">
    I've been in frontend development for just over two years now, and I've learned a lot from resources like
    FreeCodeCamp and working on freelance projects on platforms like Fiverr and Upwork. One of my favorite things to do is build
    ecommerce stores &#x1F4B3;, from designing the user interface to coding the backend. 
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="color: #7cb342;">Micro SaaS & Continuous Improvement</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 18px;">
    In addition to ecommerce, I also enjoy researching and developing Micro SaaS (Software as a Service) products.
    It's exciting to see a donation or a subscription coming in from a Chrome extension or service that I've built. 
    Frontend development is incredibly empowering to me because I get to come up with an idea, make it functional,
    and then continuously improve it over time &#x1F4D7;.
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="color: #ffa726;">Stay Up-to-Date & Full Stack Bootcamp</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 18px;">
    One thing that often gets overlooked about frontend development is the amount of research and documentation reading
    that goes into it. It's a big part of the job, and I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest technologies,
    frameworks, and best practices to continuously improve my skills. r &#x1F64C;.
